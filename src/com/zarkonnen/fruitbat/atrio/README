Atomic Text Records is the storage system used by Fruitbat.

When used append-only, ATRReader (and SimpleATRReader) will ignore all fields and records that failed to be written in their entirety, making appending fields and records atomic in practice.

The format only uses visible ASCII characters in the range of " " (32) to "~" (126). The record start marker is line feed, and the field end marker is tab, making the format readable as TSV. However note that records not terminated with "%" and fields not started with ":" should be ignored.

Backslash, colon, tab, line feed, percent and carriage return are all escaped using two-character escape codes, while all other characters not in the range of " " to "~" are represented as six-digit hexadecimal representations of their unicode code points.

An ATR file (without aborted fields or records) looks like this:
<START OF FILE>
:a	:b	:c	%
:x\ny	:fruit	:y	:\u000b17\t	%<END OF FILE>
