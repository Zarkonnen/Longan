/**
 * Writes records of UTF-8 fields into an ASCII-based format called Atomic Text Records. When used
 * append-only, ATRReader (and SimpleATRReader) will ignore all fields and records that failed to be
 * written in their entirety, making appending fields and records atomic in practice.
 *
 * The format only uses visible ASCII characters in the range of " " (32) to "~" (126). The record
 * start marker is line feed, and the field end marker is tab, making the format readable as TSV.
 * However note that records not terminated with "%" and fields not started with ":" should be
 * ignored.
 *
 * Backslash, colon, tab, line feed, percent and carriage return are all escaped using two-character
 * escape codes, while all other characters not in the range of " " to "~" are represented as
 * six-digit hexadecimal representations of their unicode code points.
